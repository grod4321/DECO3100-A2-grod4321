          <h2>Central African Republic child mortality Crisis</h2>
          <h5>How the highest child mortality rate in the world could be avoided</h5>
          <p>Despite the ever-increasing population and environmental issues, the number of child deaths have thankfully been steadily declining, from 12.58 million in 1950 to only 5.42 million in 2017 (Roser, 2019) [1] due to improvements in the medical field. Despite this, there are still large discrepancies between countries in this area, notably the country with the highest child mortality rate, Central African Republic (CRA) (IHME, 2017) [2]. According to the United Nations, CRA has the lowest life expectancy and highest child mortality rate, giving it the second lowest Human Development Index (HDI) in the world (UN, 2020) [3].<br>
          A child in CRA is almost 33 times as likely to die as one in Australia. The graph below represents this enormous disparity.</p>

        <div class="text1">
          <p>One thing that research has uncovered though is the fact that many of these deaths are completely avoidable. In fact, there is over a 50% difference in avoidable deaths in CRA as there are in Australia [2]. The leading causes of death in Australia consist of congenital anomalies, prematurity and other noncommunicable diseases. Whereas in CRA, the three biggest killers are malaria, respiratory infections (i.e. pneumonia) and, believe or not, diarrhoea, things that are barely responsible for any child deaths at all in Australia, malaria not even showing up on the radar [2]. In other words, children in Australia and CRA are dying from completely different things, and this is having an incredible effect on their quality of life (Charm, 2018) [4].<br>
            The pie charts below show the breakdown of causes of children deaths, the red being hygiene related and avoidable.</p>

        <div class="text2">
          <p>Due to CRA’s massive lack of access to health care and the fact that it is one of the poorest countries in the world (WHO, 2006) [5], they have difficulty receiving the resources and treatment necessary for consistent healthy birthing and raising of children. The fact that 56.7% of their child mortality are preventable hygiene related deaths is incredibly alarming, especially when you compare it to Australia, which is over 50% lower. That means that if CRA had greater resources and access to education, they could save the lives of over 10’000 children every year (WHO, 2018) [6].<br>
          The graph below shows the child mortality rate from 1950 to 2017 and a prediction of where it will go in the future. Although fairly inaccurate, it is indicative of a major difference in time that it will take to bring the child mortality rate of CRA down to below 1 out of 1000. It also shows the dramatic improvement that can be seen if these avoidable hygiene related deaths are brought down similar to Australia’s level.</p>

        <div class="conc">
          <p>Even though Australia and CRA seem worlds apart in bringing child mortality under control, removing simple hygiene related factors brings CRA almost 40 years closer to that goal. Global Health Actions such as the Millennium Development Goal (Jin, 2018) [7] have done an incredible job in lowering these casualties, averting 7.1 million diarrhoea and 6.7 million pneumonia related child deaths across 75 countries. These movements and actions must continue to happen across the world to improve quality of life and, most of all, save our children.</p>
